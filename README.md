### It contains below projects merged into a single repository:

1.  **ComCSharpInteropLibraries** : 
  _This solution is supposed to hold all interop libraries. At present it contains a ADO like client for Firebird DB based on COM (OLE)_
  
      - The goal of this project was to create a custom ADO like client for firebird getting all information about its DDF and other information and provide connection to .NET clients.
      - The idea is to use COM for its architecture.
      - It works when getting information about existing tables and running query.
      - **Based on:** VC++, ComponentObjectModel (OLE).
      - You can find its code here: [ComCSharpIteropLibraries](https://github.com/stephen-pinto/POC/tree/main/ComCSharpIteropLibraries)
