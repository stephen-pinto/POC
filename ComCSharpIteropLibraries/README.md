 # Firebird ADO like client based on COM architecture
 
 _This Project solution is supposed to hold all interop libraries. At present it contains a ADO like client for Firebird DB based on COM (OLE)_
  
- The goal of this project was to create a custom ADO like client for firebird getting all information about its DDF and other information and provide connection to .NET clients.
- The idea is to use COM for its architecture.
- It works when getting information about existing tables and running query.
- **Based on:** VC++, ComponentObjectModel (OLE).
